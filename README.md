# TDD Best Practices
1. First I have Created one Java File Named LeapYearCheck.java where i write Basic Code For Leap Year Checking,Based on Requirement given to this document
http://codingdojo.org/kata/LeapYears/
2. After writing implementation I will again add some test cases based on that again i will refactor Code.
3. I have Added one More Test case if the User enters negative or Zero as year.
